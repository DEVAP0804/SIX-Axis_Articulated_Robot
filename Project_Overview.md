# Project Title: Development of 6-Axis Articulated Robot with Live Camera

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated system for picking and placing delivery boxes using a six-axis articulated robot. The robot will be built from the base up, integrating various components to enhance its functionality and precision. Key elements of the system include a live camera for real-time object detection, a YOLOv5 model for identifying delivery boxes, and inverse kinematics for precise control of the robot's movements. The end effector is equipped with a suction cup mechanism to securely grasp delivery boxes.

## Detailed Explanation

### Robot Development

#### Six-Axis Articulated Robot
The core of this project is the design and development of a six-axis articulated robot. This type of robot offers a high degree of freedom, allowing it to perform complex movements and access various positions and orientations essential for picking and placing objects effectively.

#### Base Construction
The robot will be constructed from a robust base that supports the entire structure, ensuring stability during operation. The design will include essential features such as a mounting framework for the joints and motors, along with integration points for sensors and the end effector.

### Actuation and Sensors

#### Stepper Motors
The robot will be powered by stepper motors, which provide precise control over the movement of the robot's joints. Stepper motors are ideal for this application due to their ability to move in fixed increments, allowing for accurate positioning of the end effector.

#### Gyroscope
A gyroscope will be integrated into the robot to monitor its orientation and movement. This sensor will provide feedback on the robot’s position, enabling the system to make real-time adjustments and maintain stability during operation.

#### Limit Switches
Limit switches will be employed to ensure the safety and reliability of the robot. These switches will help define the operational boundaries of the robot’s movements, preventing it from exceeding its range and potentially causing damage to the robot or surrounding environment.

### Object Detection

The YOLOv5 model will be trained to recognize delivery boxes in the camera feed. Its high speed and accuracy make it suitable for real-time applications, ensuring that the robot can swiftly identify and respond to objects in its vicinity.  
The model processes the camera input and outputs the coordinates and dimensions of the identified boxes, which are crucial for the subsequent steps in the picking and placing process.

### Inverse Kinematics

To accurately position the end effector over the detected delivery box, inverse kinematics is utilized. This mathematical approach calculates the necessary joint angles and positions required for the robot arm to reach the desired location.  
The system takes the coordinates of the identified box from the YOLOv5 model and translates them into joint configurations for the robotic arm. This ensures precise movement and effective placement of the end effector.

### Automation Workflow

- **Initialization**: The system initializes the camera and robot arm, ensuring that both are calibrated and ready for operation.
- **Object Detection**: The camera captures live video, and the YOLOv5 model continuously processes the frames to detect delivery boxes.
- **Movement Planning**: Upon detecting a box, the system calculates the necessary movements using inverse kinematics to position the end effector above the box.
- **Grasping**: Once in position, the suction cup activates, allowing the end effector to pick up the box securely.
- **Placement**: The robot arm moves to the designated placement location, again utilizing inverse kinematics to ensure accuracy. The suction cup releases the box once the end effector is in the correct position.

### Applications and Benefits

This automated picking and placing system can be applied in various industries, including logistics, warehousing, and manufacturing. By integrating advanced technologies like real-time object detection and robotic manipulation, the project enhances efficiency and reduces labor costs associated with manual handling of delivery boxes.  
The use of a suction cup as the end effector allows for gentle handling of boxes, reducing the risk of damage compared to traditional grippers.

## Conclusion
This project combines cutting-edge technologies in robotics and computer vision to create an efficient automated system for handling delivery boxes. By employing a six-axis articulated robot developed from the base, utilizing stepper motors for precise movement, incorporating a gyroscope for stability, and limit switches for safety, the system is positioned to significantly enhance operational efficiency in various applications.
