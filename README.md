# SIX---Axis_Articulated_Robot
This project integrates inverse kinematics for robotic arm control with real-time object detection using YOLOv5. It features a Qt-based GUI, a Python script for calculating joint angles based on target positions, and a YOLOv5 model for detecting objects from a live camera feed, with MQTT communication for real-time updates.
